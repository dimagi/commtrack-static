## Support for Active Data Management

Active Data Management is a new offering from CommCare that provides weekly monitoring reports with specific actionable information about top-performing and low-performing CHWs.

## Direct Support & Maintenance

Community support via the [CommCare mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/commcare-users) is always available to users of CommCare.

Direct e-mail and phone support is also available to our field and engineering team for those projects that require it.

## CommCare Field Support

Dimagiâ€™s field managers bring unparalleled expertise supporting mobile applications for frontline workers, from the initial application design steps to widespread project scaling. 

Over the past several years, our field managers have deployed dozens of highly tailored applications in low-resource settings around the world. They draw upon a skillset that is focused around collaborative decision-making, rapid prototyping, and user acceptance testing with local end-users. In addition to the wealth of knowledge they bring implementing projects, their experience scaling mobile projects informs planning and decision-making around project rollout. 

Because Dimagi field managers are based where their projects are based, they work with local project coordinators to build capacity, reduce project risk, and ultimately transfer ownership of the project at its completion. This includes training large groups of end-users, stakeholders, data administrators, IT personnel, and in-country programmers to use CommCare effectively.

## Software Development for New, Custom Features

Some projects require new features to be added to the core CommCare platform to support a particular project need.

While we incorprorate community feature requests as rapidly as we can, this package allows organizations to fund a specific feature and ensure it is implemented in time for their project's timeline.
