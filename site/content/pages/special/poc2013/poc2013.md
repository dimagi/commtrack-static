As part of our focus on logistics and supply chain, Dimagi is seeking new partners in India and Nepal working in health, social enterprise, agriculture, or other sectors.

Through this RFA, Dimagi will support 5 organizations in India and Nepal to rapidly launch CommTrack, a mobile phone tool for improved logistics and supply chain management in low-resource settings. Awardees will each receive a CommTrack application designed for their mobile workforce, free phones or SMS credit, free access to the CommTrack cloud-based server for one year, and one month of free support from Dimagi's experienced Field Managers including a 2 week field visit to help launch CommTrack.

For questions and information, or to submit your finalized application, email [poc-applications@dimagi.com](mailto:poc-applications@dimagi.com). November 25 is the deadline for questions. After November 25 we will compile all questions we have received on the RFA and send them out to everyone.
