Dimagi is pleased to announce that it will support five organizations from various sectors in India and Nepal to explore the use of mobile technology for grassroots supply chain management. New mobile programs partnering with these five organizations will be launched with CommTrack, Dimagi’s innovative, open source, mobile phone-based tool. Some examples of how CommTrack can be used include:

- Health: reduce stockouts and ensure proper usage of commodities by ASHAs, Anganwadi workers, and other health workers
- Social Enterprise: improve profit, reduce waste, and avoid damage to goods or theft through real-time tracking throughout your distribution network
- Disaster Response: faster, more transparent and reliable delivery of food and shelter after a crisis
- Agriculture: optimize movement of crops to market, improve seed or fertilizer estimates, and reduce transaction costs
- Livelihoods: build the capacity of rural populations to manage and distribute goods

Through this RFA, India-based Dimagi staff will support the five partner organizations to rapidly deploy a proof-of-concept application within twelve months of the award date. Awardees will each receive a CommTrack application designed for their mobile workforce, free phones or SMS credit, free access to the CommTrack cloud-based server for one year, and one month of free support from Dimagi’s experienced Field Managers including a 2 week field visit to help launch CommTrack.
