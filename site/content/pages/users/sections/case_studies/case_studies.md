## CommCare Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA)

![CommCare ASHA in action.](/images/users/asha/commcare-asha.jpg)

In 2010, we launched the CommCare-ASHA project to deploy CommCare widely within the Accredited Social Health Activist (ASHA) program in India. The National Rural Health Mission in India is training over 750,000 ASHAs, who have demonstrated the potential to substantially improve health outcomes in areas of extreme poverty, notably in maternal health. However, ASHA programs are difficult to run effectively because ASHAs have minimal training and operate independently. CommCare is especially well suited to meet the needs of the ASHA program due to its accessibility to low-literate users,  and ability to scale nationally with high a degree of local customization.

Low-literate interface: Given varied literacy rates among ASHAs and their clients, we use audio clips and images to reinforce each prompt, creating a simple interface accessible to low-literate users.

Improved quality and consistency of care: CommCare-ASHA contains registration forms, prioritized checklists, danger sign monitoring, and educational prompts. We have found that included multimedia provides the ASHA with powerful tools to engage and educate clients.

Scale: CommCareHQ allows groups to deploy CommCare without engaging expert computer engineers. CommCareHQ will improve monitoring and health surveillance by collecting data from each household visit to provide real-time monitoring of ASHA activity and population health. 

CommCare is expanding rapidly in India. We currently have 30 partners operating CommCare in India.  CommCare is being used as the electronic job aid for frontline health workers in the large health intervention in Bihar funded by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. We are integrating CommCare with MOTECH in order to create an open source mHealth platform that includes job aids for health workers, outreach to end clients via voice and SMS, and an electronic medical record system.
