CommTrack has grown out of work done in three countries with JSI and in a fourth with UNICEF. This technology is currently being used in Tanzania (ILSGateway), Ghana (Early Warning System), Malawi (cStock), and Uganda (mTrac). 

The Ministry of Health and JSI in Tanzania are in the process of deploying this technology on a national scale. Users responding to the pilot evaluation in Tanzania indicated that the increased recognition and real-time nature of the SMS system was as powerful an incentive as monetary rewards, and reporting rates for the pilot were comparable with other systems that did provide a monetary reward for reporting. 

Today, CommTrack is in use in over 2300 facilities in Tanzania. In Ghana, JSI and MoH are deploying CommTrack across all ART facilities in the country. In Malawi, SMS reports are used directly to calculate just-in-time stock needs of over 1500 community health workers as part of the Gates-funded JSI SC4CCM initiative. CommTrack technology is being used today as part of a RapidSMS logistics module within the mTrac system in Uganda, an initiative of the Ministry of Health, UNICEF, and WHO. mTrac is currently being scaled nation-wide.
